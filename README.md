# Implementations of Data-structures and Algorithms
Practice implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms so I can get a better understanding of them and have examples to look back on in the future. 
Notes, Documentation, and Runtime Analysis for all Data-Structure functions and Algorithms.
The idea is to essentially write a library for all the common and even some uncommon data-structures and algorithms from the ground up. If a data-structure or algorithm requires a data-structure, it will use the implementation I have written.
