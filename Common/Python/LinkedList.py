#Notes:
# Linked List are common implemented either as just nodes or as a container class 
# to assist in ease of use such as looping/keeping track of the first node.

# Linked List are commonly used to implement stack and queue data structures.

# Common tasks to be done on LL are: Sorting, Reversing, Checking for Loops, and Inserting/Removing.
