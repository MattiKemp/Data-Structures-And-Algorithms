# Trees are a class of data structure that a similar to graphs except they can not have loops in them. Like most graphs they have references to 
# children (neighbors for graphs) Nodes.
# Trees are often used to implement more specific data structures such as Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Tries, etc.

# Common Tree operations: Insert, Delete, and Search.
